# pylvgl
Python bindings for the LittlevGL graphics library

This project aims at creating Python bindings (i.e. a Python module) for the [LittlevGL embedded GUI library](https://littlevgl.com). It does so by providing a bindings generator, i.e. a Python script that generates the source code for the Python module, by inspecting the LittlevGL source code.

## Use-cases

LittlevGL is aimed at embedded platforms with low resources available. As such, it may seem counter-intuitive to use it in combination with a high-level programming language such as Python. However, there are several use cases:

* Use on embedded systems

  Embedded systems are getting more and more powerfull, allowing the use of Python as a programming language, which can significantly reduce the programming effort required to create a graphical user interface. Since full-blown user interface libraries such as Qt or wxWidgets may still be too demanding for these platforms, LittleVGL combined with pylvgl may be a suitable solution.
  
* Prototyping on PC platform
  Even if Python is not used on the embedded platform, it can be used to prototype the embedded user interface
  
## Installation

Run `python setup.py install` to build and install pylvgl. The pre-built source-code of the module, `lvglmodule.c`, is included in the github repository for convenience. It can be re-generated by running `bindingsgen.py`, but this is not required for installation.
  
## Road-map

Already implemented:

* Parsing of LittlevGL source code
* Python bindings for all LittlevGL objects
* Python constants for all LittlevGL enum constants

To be implemented:

* Destruction / deletion of items
* Support for styles
* Objects should inherit from the correct type; currently the all inherit from Obj
* ...
